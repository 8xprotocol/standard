# Specification

## Summary
A standardized interface for interacting and handling subscription data.

##  Abstract
This standard defines a contract interface for interacting with subscription data. The 8x suggestions come under the feelings that implementation of how a subscription is created, is left up to the implementor. If we define a standard for implementation, we'll be locking ourselves into one way of doing things.

## Motivation
We want to set a standard for interacting with Layer 2 protocols, not how those protocols operate.
